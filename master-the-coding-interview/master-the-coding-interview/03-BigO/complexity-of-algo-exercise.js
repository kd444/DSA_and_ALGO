/*
How to calculate Complexity of an algoritm

There are three types of Algorithm
1. Sequential Algorithm: statements of algo are executed single time.
2. Iterative Algorithm: statements of algo are executed multiple time. e.g. contains for loop
3. Recursive Algorithm: program calls itself again and again. 

Complexity of Sequential Algorithm:
- Sequential Algorithm usually contains only if-statements, switch-cases so its complexity is always 
O(1)

Complexity of Iterative Algorithm:

1. for(i=1;i<1000;i++)
- Above loop is collection of 

2. for(i=1;i<n;i++)
